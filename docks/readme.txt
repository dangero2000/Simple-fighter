Tutorial:
1: Intruduction.
Simple shooter is just your usual hack and slash shooter, but with a plesent twist to make it seem more enjoyable for others to play. In this game, you're objective is to survive endless hords of enemies and other surprises that may come your way the heigher you progress.
I figured since there were a milion other titles out there, I thought, why not make my own version of it for the hell of it? Don't ask me why I called it the way it is. I couldn't come up with a better name for what to call this thing, so hear we are.
2: Game features.
This game has the folowing features:
The ability to move around in a 2d sidescroller inviroment. This means that you're able to move with the Left and Right arrow keys.
The ability to jump and turn. This is useful for dodging enemies and projectiles that come at you from sertain sides of your body.
The ability to sit and stand. I added this just for fun zees, because, why not?
The ability to choose any platform and wall you want to walk or bump into. This lets you choose any tile and wall you want to move around in.
